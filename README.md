Traffic Predictor


The Traffic Predictor is a machine learning model designed to forecast traffic conditions with high accuracy. Leveraging the power of ensemble learning, specifically Random Forest, this model achieves an impressive 94% accuracy in predicting traffic patterns.

Key Features:

Random Forest Model:

The core prediction engine based on an ensemble of decision trees.
Robust and adaptable to various traffic scenarios.


Additional Algorithms:

To enhance learning and explore different approaches, weâ€™ve incorporated the following algorithms:

Linear Regression: Provides insights into linear relationships.

Logistic Regression: Useful for binary classification tasks.

Decision Tree: A single decision tree for interpretability.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective for complex data distributions.


Usage:

Installation:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

Training and Evaluation:

Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
Train the Random Forest model using historical traffic data.
Evaluate its performance against test data.

Contributions:

Feel free to contribute enhancements, bug fixes, or new algorithms.
